# Text Modifier Script

## Description
This Python script reads the content of a specified text file, converts all the text to uppercase, and writes the modified content to a new file.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter the name of the file to read.
- The script attempts to open and read the contents of the file.
- If the file is successfully read, its content is converted to uppercase.
- The uppercase content is then saved to a new file named `modified_<original_filename>`.
- Appropriate error messages are shown if the file cannot be read or written.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the filename (including extension) when prompted.
3. If the file exists and is readable, a new file with the prefix `modified_` will be created in the same directory containing the uppercase version of the original text.

## Example
```
Enter the filename to read: example.txt
Modified content written to modified_example.txt
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Error Handling
- If the specified input file does not exist or cannot be read, the script will display an error message.
- If the script cannot write to the new file, an error message will be displayed.
